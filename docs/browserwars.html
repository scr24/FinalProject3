                Mosaic was the first browser. This made surfing the web more user friendly with a visual GUI that made tools and commands just a click away. Microsoft had come 
                out and created the operating system Windows 95. This was the basis for which a computer would run on. Microsoft viewed this one of the most important aspects of 
                a computer to have a part on as the operating system can determine what is compatible and can run with that computer. The same group that created Mosaic would 
                then work to improve upon their idea and form Netscape. Their browser was named Navigator because of its ease of navigation. This was viewed as the gateway of 
                the web making for traversing the web and hopping from webpage to webpage simple. This web browser was able to run on any computer. Netscape sat atop the 
                industry as the hottest company, even topping Microsoft. Netscape then decided to go public to gain an edge over Microsoft. Their stock was booming. Microsoft 
                retaliated by creating their own web browser called Internet Explorer, it was coincidentally yet symbolically released on the anniversary of Pearl Harbor. 
                This was a statement saying that Microsoft was ready to attack full force against Netscape. Internet Explorer was able to match Navigator function for function. 
                Microsoft refused to let Netscape maintain their lead on the market. Microsoft did have one advantage over Netscape in that they were able to seamlessly 
                integrate Internet Explorer into their operating system at no additional charge. They had millions in the bank and were willing to take the brief hit to finish 
                off Netscape, who had to charge for their browser as they had no means of revenue. Internet Explorer 4 was the final blow against Netscape which presumably 
                ended the browser wars. Following their defeat and plummeting of stocks, Netscape was purchased by AOL.
